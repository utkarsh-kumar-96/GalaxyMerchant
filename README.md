## How to Run

Pass your queries to execute method in `ParseQuery.java` file. The application will print output directly to the console.


## Application Terminology
- Input statements are referred as `Query`
- Input words like `Gold`, `Silver` or `iron` which are not denoted by Roman Numerals are referred to as `commodity` or `trade commodity`
- Input words like `glob`, `prok`, `pish` which are denoted by Roman Numerals in input statement are called `currency`

## Explanation

The program identifies the type of query using `regex` and passes it to the next `handler` until respective handler is found

| Input                                                                | Query Type             | Handler                   |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------  | ------------------------- |
| glob is I                                                            | Assign Query           | CurrencyHandler           |
| glob glob Silver is 34 Credits                                       | Trade commodity Query  | TradeHandler              |

| Does pish tegj glob glob Iron has more Credits than glob glob Gold ? | Compare Query          | ComparisonQueryHandler    |
| Is glob prok larger than pish pish?                                  | Compare Query          | ComparisonQueryHandler    |
