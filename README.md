Pass your queries to execute method in `ParseQuery.java` file. The application will print output directly to the console.


## Application Terminology

- Input words like `Gold`, `Silver` or `iron` which are not denoted by Roman Numerals are referred to as `commodity` or `trade commodity`
- Input words like `glob`, `prok`, `pish` which are denoted by Roman Numerals in input statement are called `currency`

## Explanation

The program identifies the type of query using `regex` and passes it to the next `handler` until respective handler is found

```
